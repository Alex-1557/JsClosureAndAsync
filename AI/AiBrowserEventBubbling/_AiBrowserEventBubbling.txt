Event bubbling is a fundamental mechanism in browser event handling. When an event occurs on an element, it first triggers any event listeners attached directly to that element. Then, the event "bubbles" up the DOM tree, triggering listeners on each ancestor element until it reaches the root of the document.
Event bubbling is a core concept in browser event handling. Understanding bubbling, capturing, stopPropagation, and the difference between this and event.target is crucial for effective and predictable event management in web applications. Asynchronous operations inside event handlers allow you to make network requests and other non-blocking calls without freezing the page. However, the overall flow of event handling itself is synchronous.
Performance: Excessive event listeners or deeply nested DOM structures can impact performance. Use event delegation (attaching listeners to a common ancestor) to optimize.
Unexpected Behavior: Bubbling can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. Use stopPropagation() when needed to prevent unintended side effects.
