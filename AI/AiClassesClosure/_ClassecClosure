These examples highlight how closures interact with classes, enabling private data, managing this context in callbacks and asynchronous operations, and creating class factories with encapsulated state. Understanding closures is important when working with classes in JavaScript, especially when asynchronous behavior or private data is involved. Using private class fields (#) is generally preferred now for private instance variables when possible (example 1). However, factory functions returning classes can provide additional encapsulation (example 2). Using arrow function callbacks, where appropriate, provides a clean way to maintain the correct this context (example 3). Example 4 show how async/await can handle this correctly automatically. These techniques provide powerful tools for managing state and behavior in object-oriented JavaScript.
