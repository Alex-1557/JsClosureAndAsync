AK#10.js - AK#40.js - JavaScript's concurrency model, based on the event loop and asynchronous operations, is crucial for building responsive applications. Here are examples demonstrating non-blocking behavior and how JavaScript handles multiple tasks concurrently. These examples illustrate how JavaScript's event loop and asynchronous programming enable concurrency and prevent blocking. The UI remains responsive, network requests happen concurrently, animations run smoothly, and Web Workers (example 4) provide true parallelism for intensive calculations without freezing the main thread. This non-blocking nature is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Note: Web Workers require a separate file for the worker script. The specifics of that file and how to set up the worker are given in the worker example.
