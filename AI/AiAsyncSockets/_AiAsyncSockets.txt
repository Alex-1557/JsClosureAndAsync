AN#10.js - AN#50.js - While true real-time chat requires a server and persistent connections (like WebSockets), here are examples demonstrating core client-side JavaScript concepts relevant to handling real-time updates, as would be used in a chat application. These examples provide building blocks for real-time functionality. They simulate updates for demonstration purposes. A complete real-time chat application would require a server and persistent connections (usually WebSockets) to handle communication between clients and the server. However, the client-side logic for handling incoming data, updating the UI, and sending user input would be built upon these core concepts. https://github.com/Mukhammadjon571/TourUz-Client
