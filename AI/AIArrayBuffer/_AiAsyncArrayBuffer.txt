Here are examples of asynchronous operations using ArrayBuffer and TypedArray in JavaScript, focusing on scenarios where asynchronicity is relevant (like fetching data or using Web Workers):
Differences between ArrayBuffer handling in Browser and Node.js:
Node.js Buffer: In Node.js, the Buffer object is the primary way to work with binary data. Buffer extends Uint8Array and provides methods specifically for binary data manipulation. When reading a file in Node.js, you directly get a Buffer object. Buffer objects can be easily converted to ArrayBuffers if needed (as shown in Example 4).
Browser ArrayBuffer: In the browser, ArrayBuffer is the core object representing raw binary data. TypedArrays provide views into the ArrayBuffer with specific data types (e.g., Int32Array, Float64Array).
Web Workers: Web Workers are a browser-specific feature and aren't available in Node.js. Node.js uses worker threads instead, as demonstrated in Example 5. The concept of transferring ArrayBuffer ownership (zero-copy) between threads also applies in Node.js.

These examples illustrate common asynchronous scenarios with ArrayBuffer and TypedArray in JavaScript, both in the browser and Node.js. Understanding the nuances of binary data handling in both environments is crucial for efficient and correct processing, especially when dealing with large datasets or computationally intensive tasks. Node.js's Buffer object is a powerful tool for binary manipulation on the server-side. In the browser, using ArrayBuffer and TypedArray is essential for operations like canvas drawing, WebSockets, or WebAssembly.
