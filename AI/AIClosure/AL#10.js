//Closures in Loops (Revisited) - Performance 
// Examples 1-4 are the same as the correct examples from previous responses (using let and IIFE) AC#10.js - AC#40.js, where the performance difference over var would be negligible in many circumstances but measurable at very high iteration values.

//5. Manual Loop Variable Copying:
const callbacks = [];
for(var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    let index = i; // Manual copy to create separate scope.  Very slightly faster at enormous scales because of avoiding some closure overhead.
    callbacks.push(() => { /* ... do something with index ... */ });
}

//Remember that performance considerations are highly dependent on specific use cases, browsers, and JavaScript engines. While the examples provide a general idea, proper benchmarking is essential for making performance-related decisions in real-world applications. The key with closures is to understand their power in creating manageable, maintainable, encapsulated JavaScript and not to overthink minimal performance tradeoffs except in highly specialized circumstances.
