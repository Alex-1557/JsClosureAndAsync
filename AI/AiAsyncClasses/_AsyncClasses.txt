hese examples show how to incorporate asynchronous operations within classes using async/await, Promises, callbacks (older style, now less common), and Node.js' EventEmitter. Using async/await and Promises are the current preferred way for most new asynchronous code. Proper error handling (using try...catch or .catch on Promises) is essential in real-world applications. Example 5 shows error handling using fetch. It demonstrates how to check response status and use try/catch to handle errors both within the class method and at the call site if needed. Remember to choose the approach that best suits your needs and coding style while prioritizing clear error handling and readability.
