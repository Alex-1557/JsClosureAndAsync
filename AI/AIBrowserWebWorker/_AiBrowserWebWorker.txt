Web Workers don't provide "multithreading" in the traditional sense of shared memory threads. Instead, they enable concurrency by allowing you to run JavaScript code in separate threads, parallel to the main thread. These worker threads have their own isolated execution environments (including their own global scope) and communicate with the main thread via message passing.
Here are examples demonstrating various tasks using Web Workers:
AZ#10.js - AZ#50.js
These examples illustrate common Web Worker use cases: offloading computationally intensive tasks, image manipulation, processing large datasets, and polling external resources. The key idea is to delegate work to a separate thread to prevent blocking the main thread, thereby keeping your web application responsive. Remember that communication with workers is via message passing, and you may need to use transferable objects for efficient data transfer (especially for large ArrayBuffers). Error handling within the worker is also important for robustness.
