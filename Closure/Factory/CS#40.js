//makeAdder is a function factory, the function factory creates two new functionsâ€”one that adds five to its argument, and one that adds 10.
//add5 and add10 both form closures. They share the same function body definition, but store different lexical environments. 
//In add5's lexical environment, x is 5, while in the lexical environment for add10, x is 10.
